# Project 3 Kidnapped Vehicle
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program, Project 3

## Overview
In this project you will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step your filter will also get observation and control data. 

## Basic Build Instructions
The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

cmake >= 3.5
make >= 4.1
gcc/g++ >= 5.4

To build the project:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: ` ./particle_filter '

To run the code:
Set the build directory as current directory, then run  ./particle_filter.
The following words will be shown on screen: Listening to port 4567.
Then run the simulator. In the main menu screen select Project 3: Kidnapped Vehicle

## Results
The particle filter successfully passed the test in the simulator.
